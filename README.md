The Acc.Eth DAO will solve the event economy's Catch-22 situation in hopes to kickstart thousands of (Covid protected + monetary sound) events IRL.  At #Ethdenver2022, in person, we developed the marketplace where you can a) create an event as a host and b) buy tickets, which come in the form of $TCKT representing 1 indivisible Ticket tied to an electronic event promise as a deferred means of payment (Hence, the Catch!). All (mobile) buyers acquiring one $TCKT from an event freely listed by a host (Desktop only!) prior to the end of Feb. 2022 (planned shutdown for maintenance), will be whitelisted for the DAO. The DAO builds on the following assumption: According to our white paper produced in Denver (CO) in nightshifts this week, $TCKT Buyers signal interest (in a prisoners’ dilemma) to a more long-term minded DAO, which in turn ensures against scam exits, punishes bad actors, and organized our secondary marketplace. The governance token ACC will launch fairly, rewarding purchases, and ticket validation (finality) Our values are those of the Nowhere festival! #RockOn, #CreateAlpha, be #Safe and mind you that we’ll never talk to blacklisted public addresses again.
